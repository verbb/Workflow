# Configuration
Create a `workflow.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

The below shows the defaults already used by Workflow, so you don't need to add these options unless you want to modify the values.

```php
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        // General
        'editorUserGroup' => [],
        'reviewerUserGroups' => [],
        'publisherUserGroup' => [],
        'editorNotesRequired' => [],
        'publisherNotesRequired' => [],
        'lockDraftSubmissions' => true,

        // Notifications
        'editorNotifications' => true,
        'editorNotificationsOptions' => [],
        'reviewerNotifications' => true,
        'reviewerApprovalNotifications' => false,
        'publisherNotifications' => true,
        'publishedAuthorNotifications' => false,
        'publisherNotificationsUserGroup' => null,

        // Permissions
        'enabledSections' => '*',
    ]
];
```

### Multi Site Options
For some settings like `editorUserGroup`, `reviewerUserGroups`, `publisherUserGroup`, etc. - these are multi-site configurable. You should provide a nested array of User Group UIDs with Site UIDs. For example:

```php
return [
    '*' => [
        'editorUserGroup' => [
            // Site UID => User Group UID
            '76974830-73a5-45fb-9c73-72ac8c8981dc' => '1d9e7ded-b621-48ee-9253-12a6e8f8094e',
        ],

        'reviewerUserGroups' => [
            // Site UID => Collection of User Group UIDs
            '76974830-73a5-45fb-9c73-72ac8c8981dc' => [
                ['87524453-a67b-4416-8a6e-de44c3547d18'],
                ['c23a4d8d-47f0-4e71-927c-d5897ec9c9f8'],
            ],
        ],

        'publisherUserGroup' => [
            // Site UID => User Group UID
            '76974830-73a5-45fb-9c73-72ac8c8981dc' => '8ffaff7f-b68e-4ed0-a74b-4e5596e01735',
        ],

        'editorNotesRequired' => [
            // Site UID => true/false
            '76974830-73a5-45fb-9c73-72ac8c8981dc' => true,
        ],

        'publisherNotesRequired' => [
            // Site UID => true/false
            '76974830-73a5-45fb-9c73-72ac8c8981dc' => true,
        ],
    ]
];
```
